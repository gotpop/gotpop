### Hi there 👋
I'm a Web developer with over 12 years experience.

## Demo Platform: Component-Driven Blog & Portfolio

Built a multi-project platform showcasing modern web development with shared component systems:

- **📝 [gotpop.io](https://gotpop.io)** - Personal blog with Storyblok CMS
- **💼 [work.gotpop.io](https://work.gotpop.io)** - Professional portfolio site  
- **🎨 Component System** - Shared design system across projects

**Stack**: Next.js 16 • TypeScript • Storyblok • AWS • Docker • Monorepo

Features content management, email services, CI/CD deployment, and a unified component library powering both sites.
